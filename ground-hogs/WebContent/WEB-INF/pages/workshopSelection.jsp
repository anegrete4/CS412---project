    	<h4>A Holistic Approach to Health and Behavior Issues</h4>
    	
    	<p class="Event">
    		Has your friendly puppy become fearful? Does your adult dog seem hyperactive? 
    	   Is your elderly dog restless at night? Many behavior challenges can be caused by 
    	   health problems, and behavioral changes can be early warning signs of developing health risks.
    	    Our speaker draws on her Traditional Chinese Medicine training and holistic pet care experience 
    	    to help you understand and use holistic methods to care for your pet. Case studies demonstrating
    	     how foods can be used as therapies, the benefits and cautions of medicinal herbs, and other natural
    	      remedies will be discussed. Speaker: Terri Grow
