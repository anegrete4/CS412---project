   					<h4>
   						Our workshops are a great way to learn a lot about ground-hogs quickly.
   						We offer four different free workshops for ground-hog parents every week.
      	 				They are presented by our favorite positive ground-hog trainers and other 
      	 				ground-hog related professionals in the area. Â We also demonstrate the proper use of a
      	 				variety of ground-hog toys and training products at every workshop.
